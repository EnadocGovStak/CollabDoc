# Editor Initialization Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing "Editor not ready for initialization" errors when working with the Syncfusion DocumentEditor in CollabDoc. This issue prevents document editing functionality and causes field editing problems.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Race conditions** during editor initialization
2. **Unmounting/remounting issues** without proper cleanup
3. **Concurrent initialization attempts** causing conflicts
4. **Content loading before editor readiness**
5. **Unstable editor references** not being checked properly

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Improved Editor State Tracking
- Added `isComponentMounted` ref to safely track component lifecycle
- Added `isInitializing` ref to prevent concurrent initialization attempts
- Added `initializationAttempts` counter for better debugging
- Added `lastLoadedContent` ref to prevent duplicate content loads

### 2. Enhanced Safety Checks
- Created `getEditor()` helper function that safely checks editor validity
- Added additional validation for destroyed/unavailable editor instances
- Improved error handling and fallbacks throughout the component

### 3. Robust Initialization
- Increased wait times for editor availability
- Added retry logic for initialization failures
- Better error recovery with fallback to empty document

### 4. Stable Content Loading
- Improved content deduplication logic to prevent unnecessary reloads
- Enhanced SFDT content structure detection and handling
- Better validation for content types and formats

### 5. Improved Lifecycle Management
- Enhanced cleanup on component unmount
- Better handling of state after unmount
- Proper module initialization checks

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Functionality
1. Create a new document and verify that the editor loads correctly
2. Open an existing document and verify that content appears properly
3. Edit content in the document body and verify cursor position stability
4. Save the document and verify that content is preserved

### Field Editing
1. Edit document title field and verify cursor position stability
2. Edit records management fields and verify cursor position stability
3. Test field focus behavior by tabbing between fields

### Edge Cases
1. Test with very large documents
2. Test rapid opening and closing of documents
3. Test with documents containing complex elements (tables, images)
4. Test with documents containing merge fields

### Regression Test for Cursor Reset
1. Type continuously for 30+ seconds in the editor body
2. Edit text in the middle of paragraphs
3. Copy/paste large blocks of text
4. Rapidly switch between fields

## Debugging Tips
If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any remaining error messages
2. Look for "Editor not ready for initialization" or similar errors
3. Verify that the component unmount/cleanup is working properly
4. Check for any race conditions in parent components
