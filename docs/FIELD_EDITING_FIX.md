# DocumentEditor Field Editing Fix

This document describes the changes made to fix field editing issues in the DocumentEditor component.

## Problem
Users were unable to edit fields in the DocumentEditor, including name and retention period fields.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Read-Only State Issues**: The editor was sometimes getting stuck in read-only mode due to various conditions.
2. **Focus Management**: Focus was being lost during editing operations.
3. **Selection Enablement**: Selection was not properly enabled in all cases.
4. **Document Protection**: Underlying document protection settings were preventing edits.

## Changes Made

### 1. Explicit Read-Only Handling
- Added explicit checks to ensure the editor is not in read-only mode unless specifically requested
- Added code to reset isReadOnly = false during content loading and event handling

### 2. Improved Focus Management
- Added handleEditorClick function to maintain focus when clicking in the editor container
- Added focusEditor method to the component's API for external focus control
- Added focus maintenance in the content change handler

### 3. Enhanced Selection Support
- Ensured enableSelection is properly set in both component props and direct API
- Added additional settings to explicitly enable selection in the editor

### 4. Document Protection Removal
- Added code to explicitly set protectionType to 'NoProtection'
- Ensured history tracking and editing are fully enabled

### 5. Additional Component Settings
- Added documentEditorSettings object with enableAutoFocus
- Added enableFormField and other missing settings
- Added explicit cleanup for component unmounting

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test editing all field types, especially:
   - Name fields
   - Retention period fields
   - Date fields
   - Dropdown fields

2. Test cursor movement and selection:
   - Click in different parts of fields
   - Use arrow keys for navigation
   - Select text within fields

3. Test formatting operations:
   - Bold, italic, underline
   - Font size and style changes
   - Alignment changes

4. Test document navigation:
   - Scroll through document while editing
   - Switch between different sections

If issues persist, please check:
1. Browser console for any errors
2. Document protection status
3. Any parent components that might be overriding settings
